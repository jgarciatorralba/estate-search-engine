## General API Information

- All endpoints return a JSON object with the following format

```javascript
// If everything went ok
{
  data: [{...}],
  error: null
}

// In case an error occurs
{
  data: null,
  error: "Error message"
}
```

---

## HTTP Return Codes

- HTTP `400` return code is used for malformed requests; the issue is on the sender's side.
- HTTP `401` return code is used when trying to access a protected endpoint without providing a JWT.
- HTTP `403` return code is used when trying to access a protected endpoint with an invalid JWT.
- HTTP `500` return code is used for internal errors; the issue is on the API side.
